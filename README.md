## Arrival â€“ Hotel & Apartment Booking App
> A WinUI 3 application for managing hotel and apartment bookings and rentals.

## Introduction
Arrival is a modern and intuitive platform designed to streamline the booking process for hotels and apartments. Built with the latest WinUI 3 framework, the app provides users with a seamless experience to explore, book, and manage their stays with ease.

## Appearance & Design
Created with WinUI and the latest design ideologies, Arrival is modern while keeping all of the classic features people need. We use WinUI 3 to keep our user interface, clean, modern and consistent with Windows 11 UI and UX. Although, this app does work on Windows 10 too. 

We use all of your favourite material: Acrylic. We use Microsoft's icons and controls as well as some of our own to create a generally native feeling experience. Our own controls and icons give users a truly personalised experience, being able to choose their own icon packs and with features like compact mode, you can use it on any Windows device!

## Design Patterns & Architecture
- **MVVM Architecture**
  - This helps separate the application logic from the user interface. ViewModels like `HomeViewModel`, `RentalDetailsViewModel`, etc. are registered and bound to the respective Pages.
- **Service Locator**
  - `GetService<T>()` method helps retrieve the service from the Host.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**
  - Using `Host` and `ConfigureServices` method to register services, DI pattern helps to separate dependencies and increase flexibility in configuring and replacing services.
  - Services are registered with different scopes (`Singleton`, `Transient`) to ensure appropriate lifecycle for each type of object.
- **Factory Method**
  - In `ConfigureServices`, services and ViewModels are registered with object creation methods (`AddTransient`, `AddSingleton`). This structure allows flexibility in creating new objects or reusing singleton objects.
- **Page Service**
  - The `PageService` (inherited from `IPageService`) is responsible for managing the mapping between ViewModel and Page. The `Configure<VM, V>()` method is used to configure ViewModel and Page pairs, ensuring that each ViewModel has a corresponding Page.
- **Lifecycle-aware Component**
  - The `INavigationAware` interface defines methods related to navigation. When a ViewModel implements this interface, it provides logic for handling navigation events, such as moving to a page (`OnNavigatedTo`) or leaving a page (`OnNavigatedTo`).
- **Facades Interface**
  - To simplify access to complex subsystems, the **Facade pattern** is used with interfaces like `HomeFacade`, `RentalDetailFacade`, and others. These facades abstract and encapsulate business logic, exposing only necessary methods to the ViewModel for better modularity and maintainability.
- **ViewModel Step Manager**
  - A custom manager for multi-step workflows like `Create New Listing`. It coordinates navigation between steps by tracking current progress and maintaining state, enabling a seamless user experience while ensuring modular ViewModels for each step.
  - Each Step has a ViewModel that inherits from the abstract partial class `BaseStepViewModel`.

## Advanced Topics
- **Acrylic System Backdrops**
  - Provide a different background for a Window other than the default white or black (depending on Light or Dark theme)
  - Desktop Acrylic are the current supported backdrops
- **Dark Theme**
  - This application supports Light and Dark themes as a personalization option in application settings
  - We use Light mode by default, but users can choose Dark mode, which changes much of the UI to a dark color
- **Attached Drop Shadow**
  - Allows many elements to share a common backdrop for casting shadows
  - Applied to `Schedule Search Bar` in Home Page
- **Connected Animations**
  - Created a dynamic and compelling navigation experience by animating the transition of an element between two different views
  - Applied to the Item Thumbnail named `itemHero` in Home Page & Rental Details Page
- **Auto Suggest Box**
  - A text control that makes suggestions to users as they type. The app is notified when text has been changed by the user and is responsible for providing relevant suggestions for this control to display
  - Applied to `Search Destination` in Home Page and `Navigation Item` in Shell Page
- **Inverse Background Brush**
  - A Background theme resource that inverts the control's background brush bases on the background of the application
  - Applied to several buttons like `Book Now`, `Submit Question`
- **Auto Scroll to Top**
  - Helps scroll to top of the main `ScrollView` when repeatedly navigate to a page
  - Optimize page resources when reloading
  - Applied to Rental Details Page
- **Adaptive Grid View**
  - This control presents items in a evenly-spaced set of columns to fill the total available display space. It reacts to changes in the layout as well as the content so it can adapt to different form factors automatically.
  - Applied to Home Page & Rental Details Page
- **Flip View & Pips Pager**
  - `FlipView` allows flipping through a collection of items, one at a time. It's great for displaying images from a gallery, pages of a magazine, or similar items.
  - `PipsPager` allows the user to navigate through a paginated collection and is independent of the content shown.
  - Applied to every image collection views
- **API Integration (GeoNames)**
  - Integrated with `GeoNames API` for geographic data like location search and auto-completion, enhancing location-based features such as maps and travel suggestions.
- **WebView2 Integration**
  - Integrated with WebView2 to embed `Google Maps` into the application for location-based functionalities.
  - Key feature is URL Handling that intercept navigation events to extract geographic coordinates.
- **System Notification & Activation Handling**
  - Implements **Windows** notifications and activation handling for user alerts.
  - Ensures proper lifecycle management when users interact with notifications (e.g., booking confirmations or reminders).
