## Arrival – Hotel & Apartment Booking App
> A WinUI 3 application for managing hotel and apartment bookings and rentals.

## Introduction
> Arrival is a modern and intuitive platform designed to streamline the booking process for hotels and apartments. Built with the latest WinUI 3 framework, the app provides users with a seamless experience to explore, book, and manage their stays with ease.

## Appearance & Design
> Created with WinUI and the latest design ideologies, Arrival is modern while keeping all of the classic features people need. We use WinUI 3 to keep our user interface, clean, modern and consistent with Windows 11 UI and UX. Although, this app does work on Windows 10 too. 

> We use all of your favourite materials: Mica and Acrylic. We use Microsoft's icons and controls as well as some of our own to create a generally native feeling experience. Our own controls and icons give users a truly personalised experience, being able to choose their own icon packs and with features like compact mode, you can use it on any Windows device!
